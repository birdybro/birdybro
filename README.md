### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm birdybro!

I do IT Support stuff at a plastics manufacturing company for my day job and try to learn everything I can about software programming, hardware description languages, and much more in my spare time.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on demonstrating my skills so I can position myself more competitively in my career.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Verilog/SystemVerilog hardware description languages.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the MiSTer FPGA project!

âš¡ Fun fact: I have two wonderful parrots, hence the username...  

Some stuff I've done:

* [Made an aesthetically pleasing and SEO-able documentation site for the MiSTer FPGA project](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/MkDocs_MiSTer)
* Ported multiple FPGA cores over to the MiSTer FPGA platform:
  * [Mystic Marathon](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-MysticMarathon_MiSTer)
  * [Joust 2](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-Joust2_MiSTer)
  * [Inferno](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-Inferno_MiSTer)
  * [Turkey Shoot](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-TurkeyShoot_MiSTer)
  * [Tropical Angel](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-TropicalAngel_MiSTer)
* Completed the digital logic design and implementation portions of Nand2Tetris and ported the course's ALU to verilog both in structural and in behavioral form.
* Certified ISO 13485/9001 internal auditor.
